# python chat bot
I wanted to create a chatbot in python using the ChatGPT API. \
Besides typing to communicate with the chatbot, I want to experiment \
with including voice recognition or even text to speech (will research more) \

## Getting Started
Have the latest version of Python installed. Then clone the repo locally \
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gav1012/pythonchatbot.git
