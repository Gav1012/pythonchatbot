# python chat bot
I wanted to create a chatbot in python using the ChatGPT API. \
Besides typing to communicate with the chatbot, I want to experiment \
with including voice recognition or even text to speech (will research more) \
Current looking at using Microsoft Azure TTS to listen to the mic \
