# python chat bot
I wanted to create a chatbot in using Python and the OpenAI API that you use to talk to \
any person, character, or thing that a user wants to but with more interactivity than just \
type back and forth. With that, I am using Microsoft Azure to power the speech to text to \
allow for seamless communication between the user and the bot (depending on processing of \
the user's input). Then using the text to speech to then voice the bot's response. Possibly \
looking into other ways to have custom voices for the bot.


## Getting Started
Have the latest version of Python installed. Then clone the repo locally \
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gav1012/pythonchatbot.git
